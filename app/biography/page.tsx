          I still remember the moment a computer stopped feeling like a sealed
          box. I was in 5th grade when my elder cousin came home from school
          with a piece of paper filled with code. He typed it in, hit run, and a
          digital clock appeared on the screen. I didn&apos;t know what programming
          was back then, but I knew I had just watched written instructions turn
          into something real. That idea stayed with me.

          Growing up in Kashmir, there wasn&apos;t a culture around programming or
          building software. There were no coders around me, no mentors, no
          clear path that said, this is something you can do. Computers were
          seen as tools, not creative instruments, and spending too much time on
          them was often discouraged. More than once, people tried—directly or
          indirectly—to pull me away from this interest, nudging me toward
          “safer” or more conventional directions. Still, I kept coming back.
        </p>
        <p>
          Slowly, curiosity turned into persistence. I started experimenting on
          my own, building small programs, making mistakes, and figuring things
          out the hard way. Calculators, quiz apps, little ideas that worked
          just enough to keep me going. I didn&apos;t have a grand plan or early
          validation—I was learning in isolation, driven mostly by the quiet
          satisfaction of making something work.
        </p>
        <p>
          College gave me structure and vocabulary for what I had been doing
          instinctively. Studying computer science helped me understand the
          theory behind the experiments, and I expanded into web, mobile, and
          backend development. Over time, my interests shifted from just
          building features to understanding systems—how applications are
          designed, how data moves, and why certain architectural choices matter
          in the long run.
        </p>

          Life outside tech wasn&apos;t linear. Health issues, prolonged stress,
          emotional setbacks, and periods of burnout forced me to slow down and
          recalibrate more than once. Those experiences reshaped how I think—not
          just about code, but about sustainability, learning, and growth. I
          became more deliberate, more systems-oriented, and more focused on
          building things that last rather than rushing toward outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, I work as a full-stack developer with a strong backend focus,
          primarily in the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem. I prefer learning by
          building real systems, reading documentation, and understanding
          trade-offs instead of following rigid roadmaps. Clean architecture,
          clarity of thought, and long-term maintainability matter more to me
          than trends or hype.

          What began as watching a digital clock run on a screen has turned into
          a long-term relationship with problem-solving itself. In a place where
          the path wasn&apos;t obvious and the environment wasn&apos;t designed for this
          kind of work, I kept going anyway. I&apos;m still learning, still refining
          how I think, and still drawn to the same idea that caught my attention
          years ago—that with the right logic and enough patience, you can shape
          complexity into something meaningful.
